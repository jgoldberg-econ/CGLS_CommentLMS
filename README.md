# README for replication of "A Comment on: Low Interest Rates, Market Power, and Productivity Growth," by Craig A. Chikis, Jonathan Goldberg, and David LÃ³pez-Salido (2023).


## How to run code 
Clone the Git repo. Set your working directory to the repo and run `main.m`.


## Approach

Our code heavily leverages the LMS replication code, downloaded from the Econometrica website, so that a reader can see clearly and precisely how we deviate from their code.  Comments (%) in the scripts and functions indicate where code is obtained directly from LMS's code without modification.  Where the LMS code is modified, comments explain the modifications.  

The MATLAB script `transition_figs.m` replicates Figures 1 and 2 in our comment.

The MATLAB script `bgp_figs.m` replicates Figure 3 in our comment.

## Uniformization and value function iteration

We have confirmed the results from our code here using a second, distinct replication code that uses "standard" numerical methods from the Aghion-Howitt literature.  Specifically, we solve for investment success rates using uniformization and value function iteration (see Acemoglu and Akcigit, JEEA 2012).  This second code is available from the authors upon request.
